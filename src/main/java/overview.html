    Seriously Common Lib is a collection of common solutions to robot problems
    that FRC teams face while using WPILib and Java. It attempts to streamline
    basic functionality, provide the framework for more advanced programs, and
    promote clean and well-written code. It functions primarily as a wrapper
    around WPILib which allows the robot code to run separately from the
    robot-specific library and HAL, enabling unit tests that can be run on a
    PC or CI server.

    For new teams that are haven't done much advanced programming before,
    this library has all the core code that is needed to get a robot running
    with advanced functionality without having to write the core systems
    from scratch. For more advanced teams, the common lib gives you a solid
    foundation of all the basics to start building your robot code on top of.
    You don't need to use the pre-built drive system or any of the other parts
    of the library if you don't want to; it's all modular.
