/**
 * The ITimestampedDataSubscriber interface provides a method for consumers
 * of navX-Model device data to be rapidly notified whenever new data
 * has arrived.
 *
 * - timestampedDataReceived():  reception of sensor-timestamped data
 *
 *  A "sensor" timestamp is provided, generated by the navX-Model device, which is
 *  at millisecond resolution.  A "system timestamp", also at millisecond resolution,
 *  is also provided, which represents as accurately as possible the time at which the 
 *  data was acquired from the navX-Model device.  Note that the "system timestamp" 
 *  typically has more jitter since it is generated by the host of the navX-Model 
 *  device.
 *
 *  Thus, in general sensor timestamps are preferred, as they are generated
 *  by the navX-Model device motion processor and has a greater accuracy (+/- 1ms) than the
 *  system timestamp which is vulnerable to latencies introduced by the
 *  host operating system.
 *
 *  The system timestamp is provided to allow performance monitoring of the 
 *  navX-Model device host's data acquisition process.
