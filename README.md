# Seriously Common Lib for FRC Teams

Seriously Common Lib is a collection of common solutions to robot problems that FRC teams face while using WPILib and Java. This library aims to:
- Be fully testable. Every class is built so that it can be run on a development PC, using mock implementations and factories.
- Provide simple solutions to complex problems to remove implemention details from the main codebase.
- Maintain good programming practices to make it easily integratable with existing codebases.
- Provide advanced functionality with a simple API.
