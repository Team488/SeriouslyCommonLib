# Seriously Common Lib for FRC
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Team488/SeriouslyCommonLib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Team488/SeriouslyCommonLib)

Seriously Common Lib is a collection of common solutions to robot problems that FRC teams face while using WPILib and Java. This library aims to:
- Be fully testable. Every class is built so that it can be run on a development PC, using mock implementations and factories.
- Provide simple solutions to complex problems to remove implemention details from the main codebase.
- Maintain good programming practices to make it easily integratable with existing codebases.
- Provide advanced functionality with a simple API.

## State of development

We are currently in the process of refactoring this library to make it a good foundation to start developing new functionality. At the moment, the core components have been implemented, but are fractured across multiple disparate packages. Once we finish getting all the existing functionality prepared for broader use, we will start to implement new features and expand upon existing ones.
