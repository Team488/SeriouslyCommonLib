# Seriously Common Lib for FRC [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Team488/SeriouslyCommonLib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Team488/SeriouslyCommonLib)

## What is it?

Seriously Common Lib is a collection of common solutions to robot problems that FRC teams face while using WPILib and Java. It attempts to streamline basic functionality, provide the framework for more advanced programs, and promote clean and well-written code.

## Who's working on it?
SeriouslyCommonLib started as a separation of the commonly-written sections of code from FRC team 488 Xbot. We wanted to write re-usable code that could significantly decrease the time it took to get started in subsequent years. In doing so, we developed loads of useful utilities and wrappers and kept them separate from our season code so that we could publish it when we had the time.

We plan to continue maintaining this codebase throughout upcoming years as we develop new functionality an find areas to fix and improve.

## What does it do?
*TODO*

This library aims to:
- Be fully testable. Every class is built so that it can be run on a development PC, using mock implementations and factories.
- Provide simple solutions to complex problems to remove implemention details from the main codebase.
- Maintain good programming practices to make it easily integratable with existing codebases.
- Provide advanced functionality with a simple API.

## State of development

We are currently in the process of refactoring this library to make it a good foundation to start developing new functionality. At the moment, the core components have been implemented, but are fractured across multiple disparate packages. Once we finish getting all the existing functionality prepared for broader use, we will start to implement new features and expand upon existing ones.
